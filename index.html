            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny&rsquo;s worth.

            &ldquo; I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
            I&rsquo;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
            people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
            intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
            thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
            time of my life. Since completing the course, I&rsquo;ve
            successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
            VR startup. &rdquo;

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
            Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was

            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
            personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart

              &ldquo; Before joining the bootcamp, I&rsquo;ve never written a
              line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
              help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
              by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
              about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
              disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
              for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
              outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
              no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I&rsquo;ve often referred to
              it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
              certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
              receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! &rdquo;
